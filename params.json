The code can be download and the IRM used are aviable as a set of matlab file (.mat). The original github page can be found [here](https://github.com/chuzelph-ENSTA-Bretagne/ThromboseIRM).\r\n\r\n### Purpose of this bachelor study\r\nAfter many difficulties ...\r\n\r\n### Unsupervised classification\r\nThe algorithm used here is the spectral classification. The main interest of this spectral classification is that it is adapted to signal classification. Thanks to the perfusion IRM, we can extract signal which provide information about the part of the brain we are studying. The whole code can be reused for other application as long as you reshape your input inside a matrix m*n where the row m correspond to the sample m and n correspond to the descriptors of each sample.\r\n\r\n### Quick explanation\r\n\r\n![Example of affinity matrix](https://github.com/chuzelph-ENSTA-Bretagne/ThromboseIRM/blob/master/RapportVersionFinale/Images/matrixAffinity.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nIn the end, we arrived to those results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ideas of amelioration\r\n\r\n\r\n",
