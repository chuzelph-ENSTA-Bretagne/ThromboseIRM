The code can be download and the IRM used are aviable as a set of matlab file (.mat).\r\n\r\n### Unsupervised classification\r\nThe algorithm used here is the spectral classification. The main interest of this spectral classification is that it is adapted to signal classification. Thanks to the perfusion IRM, we can extract signal which provide information about the part of the brain we are studying.\r\n\r\n",
