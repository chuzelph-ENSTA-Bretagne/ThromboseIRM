By generalising and modifying the method developed in \cite{tartare2014contribution}, this study proposes a new methodology using spectral clustering for the automatic segmentation of MRI images of brain.

The experimental results show that our algorithm is able to isolate the pathology from healthy tissues. Presently, we have only a reliable algorithm that seems to provide good results. However, we are currently studying two options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Realization of parametric map of the area which can provide other information. For brain tissues, the two relevant parameters are the cerebral blood volume (CBV) and the cerebral blood flow (CBF)  \cite{muir2014quantitative}.
\item Later on, we should realize a multi-modal analyse which imply to analyse other kind of MRI sequences in order to extract other sources of information.

\end{itemize}

We are targeting to provide a unsupervised clustering algorithm which would be able to fully identify and segmented pathological tissues of the brain.
